## Rejection Categories

### Technical Rejections
- Frameworks that were too complex for the use case
- Libraries that added too many dependencies
- Architectures that broke the 300-line rule
- Patterns that required too much boilerplate

### Scope Rejections
- Features that were "cool" but not essential
- Optimizations that were premature
- Abstractions that weren't needed yet
- "Future-proofing" that added complexity

### User Experience Rejections
- Interfaces that tested poorly
- Workflows that were too complex
- Features that confused users
- Solutions looking for problems

## Guidelines for Rejection

### When to Reject Immediately
- Would require more than 3 files to implement
- Adds dependencies without clear necessity
- Solves problems that don't exist yet
- Can't be explained simply
- Would break existing working code

### Red Flags
- "This will be useful later"
- "While we're here, let's also..."
- "This is the proper way to do it"
- "All good projects have this"
- "It's a best practice"
