# Project Trends Analysis

You are analyzing development trends across this project to identify patterns, predict potential issues, and recommend proactive improvements.

## Trend Analysis Framework

### 1. File Growth Trajectory Analysis

**Size Evolution Tracking:**
```bash
# Analyze file growth over time
for file in $(find src -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx"); do
  current_size=$(wc -l < "$file")
  commit_count=$(git log --oneline "$file" | wc -l)
  echo "$file: $current_size lines, $commit_count commits"
done | sort -k2 -nr
```

**Growth Pattern Categories:**
- **Stable Files**: Consistent size, infrequent changes
- **Growing Files**: Steadily increasing in size
- **Volatile Files**: Frequent size changes
- **New Files**: Recently created, still evolving

**Predictive Indicators:**
- Files approaching 250-line warning threshold
- Files with consistent growth velocity
- Components gaining responsibilities over time
- Areas of the codebase under heavy development

### 2. Development Velocity Trends

**Commit Pattern Analysis:**
```bash
# Recent activity patterns
git log --oneline --since="4 weeks ago" | wc -l
git log --oneline --since="2 weeks ago" | wc -l
git log --oneline --since="1 week ago" | wc -l
```

**Velocity Indicators:**
- Commit frequency changes
- File modification patterns
- Feature completion rates
- Bug fix frequency vs. new feature work

**Team Productivity Signals:**
- Sprint completion consistency
- Technical debt accumulation rate
- Time spent on maintenance vs. new features
- Code review cycle times

### 3. Technical Debt Accumulation Trends

**Debt Growth Tracking:**
```bash
# TODO/FIXME trend over time
git log --grep="TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" --oneline --since="4 weeks ago" | wc -l
grep -r "TODO\|FIXME\|HACK" src/ | wc -l
```

**Debt Categories:**
- **Code Quality Debt**: Style, naming, organization issues
- **Architectural Debt**: Design decisions that need revisiting
- **Documentation Debt**: Missing or outdated documentation
- **Test Debt**: Inadequate or missing test coverage

**Debt Trajectory Indicators:**
- Rate of new TODO comments
- Frequency of "quick fix" commits
- Increasing complexity in code reviews
- Growing debugging time for new features

### 4. Scope Management Trends

**Scope Adherence Tracking:**
- Features added vs. documented scope
- Time spent on unplanned work
- Frequency of scope adjustments
- Parked feature accumulation rate

**Scope Drift Indicators:**
- Features not in original project documentation
- Components handling responsibilities outside their domain
- Increasing project complexity without proportional value
- Team discussions about "what this project should do"

### 5. Quality Metric Trends

**Structural Quality:**
- File size distribution changes
- Import complexity evolution
- Folder organization stability
- Component reusability patterns

**Process Quality:**
- Health check pass rates
- Constraint violation frequency
- Emergency protocol activation
- Documentation currency

### 6. Team Learning Curve Analysis

**Learning Indicators:**
- Time to complete similar tasks trending down
- Reduced debugging time for common issues
- Fewer repeated mistakes in code reviews
- Increased adherence to guidelines over time

**Knowledge Distribution:**
- Team member contribution patterns
- Code ownership concentration
- Review feedback consistency
- Onboarding time for new features
