# CLAUDE.md - AI Development Guidelines

## 📁 Project Organization

**File Structure Rules:**
- All `.md` files (except this CLAUDE.md) go in `docs/` folder
- Frontend code belongs in `src/frontend/`
- Backend code belongs in `src/backend/`
- Shared utilities belong in `src/shared/`
- Keep root directory clean

**Documentation References:**
Use `@filename` to reference other documentation:
- `@api.md` - API documentation and endpoints
- `@architecture.md` - System design and structure
- `@deployment.md` - Deployment and environment setup
- `@testing.md` - Testing strategies and guidelines

## 🤖 Working with AI

### Effective Requests
- **Be specific** about file paths and folder structure
- **Provide context** about existing code and architecture
- **Ask for organized code** - specify target folders
- **Request documentation** alongside implementation
- **Reference docs** using `@filename` when asking for related changes

### Good Prompt Examples
```
"Create a user authentication component in src/frontend/components/ following @api.md"
"Add error handling to the API in src/backend/services/ per @architecture.md guidelines"
"Review this code for best practices and update @testing.md if needed"
"Implement the payment flow described in @api.md"
```

## 💡 Core Principles

### Code Quality
- **Single Responsibility**: One function, one purpose
- **Consistent Naming**: Clear, descriptive variable and function names
- **Error Handling**: Always handle edge cases and failures
- **Documentation**: Comment complex logic, document APIs

### Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from presentation
- **Modular Design**: Break large components into smaller, reusable pieces
- **Clear Dependencies**: Minimize coupling between modules
- **Logical Grouping**: Related files should be in the same folder

### Best Practices
- **Test Early**: Write tests alongside features
- **Iterate Small**: Make incremental, reviewable changes
- **Review Often**: Ask AI to review code for improvements
- **Document Decisions**: Explain why, not just what

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Plan** → Discuss structure and approach (reference @architecture.md)
2. **Implement** → Request organized, tested code (follow @testing.md)
3. **Review** → Ask for optimization and security checks
4. **Document** → Update relevant docs in `docs/` folder using `@filename` references

## 📚 Documentation Standards

- **Cross-reference** related docs using `@filename`
- **Keep docs updated** when making code changes
- **Link implementations** to their documentation
- **Use consistent** `@` references across all files

Example: "This component implements the auth flow described in @api.md"

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls

- Dumping code in wrong folders
- Missing error handling
- Overly complex solutions
- Undocumented business logic
- Inconsistent code style

**Remember**: Good code is clean, organized, and maintainable. When in doubt, ask AI to explain the reasoning behind suggestions.
