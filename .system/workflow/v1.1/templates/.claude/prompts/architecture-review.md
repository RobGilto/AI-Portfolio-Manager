# Architecture Review and Analysis

You are conducting an architectural analysis of this codebase to identify structural strengths, weaknesses, and improvement opportunities while maintaining the disciplined development approach.

## Review Objectives

### 1. Structural Health Assessment
Evaluate the current architecture against CLAUDE.md principles and industry best practices for maintainable, scalable code.

### 2. Constraint Effectiveness Analysis
Assess how well the 300-line file limit, 3-import maximum, and single responsibility principles are working in practice.

### 3. Evolutionary Guidance
Provide specific recommendations for architectural improvements that maintain development velocity while reducing complexity.

## Analysis Framework

### A. Component Architecture Review

**Single Responsibility Analysis:**
- Identify components with clear, single purposes
- Flag components handling multiple concerns
- Assess component coupling and cohesion
- Review component interface design

**Size and Complexity Assessment:**
```bash
# Analyze component complexity
find src/components -name "*.js" -o -name "*.jsx" -o -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -exec wc -l {} + | sort -nr
```

**Reusability Patterns:**
- Components used across multiple contexts
- Over-abstracted components (premature optimization)
- Under-abstracted repeated patterns
- Effective composition patterns

### B. Service Layer Architecture

**Business Logic Organization:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Service responsibility boundaries
- Data flow patterns
- Error handling consistency

**Integration Patterns:**
- API communication strategies
- State management approaches
- Side effect handling
- Async operation patterns

### C. File Organization Effectiveness

**Folder Structure Analysis:**
```bash
# Review current structure
find src -type d | head -20
tree src -d -L 3
```

**Co-location Principles:**
- Related files grouped appropriately
- Feature-based vs. type-based organization
- Import distance and complexity
- Navigation and discoverability

### D. Dependency Architecture

**Import Graph Analysis:**
```bash
# Analyze import patterns
grep -r "^import" src/ | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr
```

**Dependency Health:**
- Circular dependency detection
- Deep import chains
- External dependency usage
- Internal coupling patterns

### E. State Management Architecture

**State Organization:**
- Global vs. local state decisions
- State update patterns
- Data flow predictability
- Performance implications

**State Boundaries:**
- Clear ownership of state pieces
- State sharing strategies
- State synchronization approaches
- Side effect management
