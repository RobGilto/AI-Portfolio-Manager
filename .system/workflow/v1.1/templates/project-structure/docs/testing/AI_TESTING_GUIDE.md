# AI Agent Testing Guide

## When to Request Human Testing

### Mandatory Human Testing Scenarios
- [ ] **New UI/UX features** - Human usability assessment required
- [ ] **User workflow changes** - Human experience validation needed  
- [ ] **Complex business logic** - Human validation of requirements understanding
- [ ] **Integration features** - Human testing of end-to-end workflows
- [ ] **Performance-critical features** - Human perception of responsiveness

### Optional Human Testing Scenarios  
- [ ] **Backend API changes** - Can be primarily automated
- [ ] **Utility functions** - Unit tests may be sufficient
- [ ] **Bug fixes** - Unless they impact user experience
- [ ] **Refactoring** - If behavior doesn't change

## Human Testing Request Protocol

### Step 1: Feature Completion Check
Before requesting human testing, ensure:
- [ ] All automated tests pass
- [ ] Code follows development discipline (300-line limit, PURPOSE comments)
- [ ] Feature is functionally complete
- [ ] Documentation is updated

### Step 2: Create Testing Documentation
1. **Copy feature testing template**
   ```bash
   cp docs/testing/features/FEATURE_TESTING_TEMPLATE.md docs/testing/features/[feature-name].md
   ```

2. **Customize testing instructions**
   - Fill in feature-specific scenarios
   - Define expected outcomes
   - Specify console commands and screenshot requirements
   - Include edge cases and error conditions

3. **Prepare feedback collection**
   - Provide copy of HUMAN_TESTING_TEMPLATE.md
   - Customize questions for specific feature
   - Define success criteria

### Step 3: Make the Request
Use this exact phrasing:

> "I've completed implementing [feature name]. Would you like to participate in testing this feature and provide feedback? 
> 
> I've prepared detailed testing instructions in `docs/testing/features/[feature-name].md` and a feedback template for you to document your results. This includes:
> - Step-by-step testing scenarios
> - Console commands to run  
> - Screenshots to capture
> - Feedback collection template
>
> Your human testing and feedback will help ensure the feature meets real-world usage needs."

## Processing Human Feedback

### Step 1: Review Feedback Systematically
- [ ] **Critical Issues:** Address immediately before continuing
- [ ] **Major Issues:** Plan fixes in current development cycle  
- [ ] **Minor Issues:** Add to backlog for future enhancement
- [ ] **Enhancement Suggestions:** Evaluate for current or future scope

### Step 2: Feedback Integration Actions
1. **Fix Critical Issues First**
   - Break any that block core functionality
   - Test fixes with original scenarios

2. **Update Feature Based on Insights**
   - Implement approved enhancements
   - Improve error handling based on feedback
   - Enhance user experience based on usability observations

3. **Update Documentation**
   - Incorporate real usage patterns discovered
   - Update known limitations based on human testing
   - Add edge cases discovered by human tester

### Step 3: Follow-up Testing (if needed)
If significant changes made based on feedback:
- [ ] Re-run automated tests
- [ ] Consider additional human testing for major changes
- [ ] Update testing documentation with lessons learned

## Testing Documentation Standards

### Feature Testing Instructions Must Include:
- [ ] **Clear objective** for each test scenario
- [ ] **Step-by-step instructions** that assume no prior knowledge
- [ ] **Expected results** for each step
- [ ] **Console commands** to run with expected output
- [ ] **Screenshot requirements** with specific states to capture
- [ ] **Error scenarios** and how to trigger them
- [ ] **Performance expectations** where relevant

### Feedback Templates Must Include:
- [ ] **Structured format** for consistent reporting
- [ ] **Console log collection** instructions
- [ ] **Screenshot attachment** guidelines  
- [ ] **Success/failure criteria** for each scenario
- [ ] **Open feedback sections** for unexpected discoveries
- [ ] **Enhancement suggestion** areas
- [ ] **Usability assessment** questions

## Common Testing Patterns

### UI Feature Testing Pattern
1. **Visual State Testing**
   - Before/during/after screenshots
   - Responsive design checks
   - Error state displays

2. **Interaction Testing** 
   - Click/touch interactions
   - Form submissions
   - Navigation flows

3. **Accessibility Testing**
   - Keyboard navigation
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Color contrast

### API Feature Testing Pattern
1. **Request/Response Testing**
   - Valid input scenarios
   - Invalid input handling
   - Error response formats

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Database interactions
   - External service calls
   - Authentication flows

### Performance Feature Testing Pattern
1. **Load Testing**
   - Response time measurements
   - Resource usage monitoring
   - Concurrent user scenarios

2. **Scalability Testing**
   - Data volume handling
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Network efficiency
