## Parking Guidelines

### Good Candidates for Parking
- Features that are "nice to have" but not core
- Optimizations before basic functionality works
- Features with unclear requirements
- Anything that would add more than 2 files
- Ideas that came up during other work ("while we're here")

### When to Unpark
- Core functionality is complete and stable
- User feedback specifically requests the feature
- Implementation becomes obvious and simple
- Can be added without breaking existing code
