# AIPortfolio Hook System v1.2

## Overview

The global hook system enables automated workflows after AI feature completion, including:
- Human testing request and feedback collection
- Automated health monitoring
- Documentation synchronization
- Cross-project workflow coordination

## Hook Types

### 1. Feature Completion Hook
**Trigger:** After AI completes feature implementation
**Actions:**
- Creates human testing documentation
- Requests human participation
- Collects and processes feedback
- Routes to appropriate next steps

### 2. Health Check Hook  
**Trigger:** Scheduled or on-demand
**Actions:**
- Monitors file size compliance
- Checks PURPOSE comments
- Validates project health metrics

### 3. Documentation Sync Hook
**Trigger:** After code changes
**Actions:**
- Updates CLAUDE.md if needed
- Syncs README with package.json
- Maintains documentation currency

## Global Commands

```bash
# Check hook system status
npm run hooks:status

# Run health checks across all projects  
npm run hooks:health-all

# Trigger feature completion (from project directory)
npm run hooks:feature "feature-name" "description"
```

## Project Commands

From within any project directory:

```bash
# Trigger feature completion hook
node hooks.js feature-completed "feature-name" "description"

# Run project health check
node hooks.js health-check

# Sync project documentation
node hooks.js sync-docs
```

## Integration with AI Development

### When AI Completes a Feature:
1. AI calls: `node hooks.js feature-completed "auth-system" "User authentication"`
2. Hook creates testing documentation in `docs/testing/features/`
3. Human is prompted to test and provide feedback
4. System processes feedback and routes to next steps

### Human Testing Workflow:
1. **Testing Documentation Created** - Step-by-step instructions
2. **Human Participation Requested** - Optional but recommended
3. **Feedback Collection** - Structured form in markdown
4. **Automatic Routing** - Based on feedback:
   - ‚úÖ Ready for production
   - üîÑ Minor fixes needed  
   - üõ†Ô∏è Major rework required
   - üìã Additional features requested

## Configuration

Hook configuration is stored in `workflow/v1.2/hooks/hooks.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "feature-completion": {
      "enabled": true,
      "projects": "all",
      "timeout": 300000
    }
  }
}
```

## Logs and Monitoring

- Hook execution logs: `workflow/v1.2/hooks/hooks.log`
- Testing archives: `docs/testing/archive/`
- Health check results: Project-specific output

## Customization

Projects can add custom hooks by:
1. Creating hook scripts in project directory
2. Adding to project `hooks.js` exports
3. Updating package.json scripts

This system enhances the disciplined development process with automated human-AI collaboration workflows.
