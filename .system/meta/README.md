# Meta-Analysis System

*Cross-project learning, patterns, and continuous improvement*

## Purpose

The meta system captures insights that span multiple projects:
- **Patterns**: What problems recur and how to solve them
- **Victories**: What approaches consistently work well
- **Triggers**: Early warning signs of problems
- **Prevention**: Proactive measures to avoid known failures
