- Developer satisfaction: Significant improvement

**Replication Guide**:
1. Create PARKED.md template
2. Train team on immediate idea capture
3. Set up weekly parking lot reviews
4. Celebrate good "parking" decisions

### Victory: 3-2-1 Development Rhythm
**Date**: [Implementation date]
**Impact**: Increased feature completion rate by 70%
**Projects Affected**: All individual contributor work
**Approach**:
- 3 minutes: Clear objective + PURPOSE comment
- 2 minutes: Minimal implementation
- 1 minute: Test and verify scope
- Repeat cycle

**Metrics**:
- Feature completion: 45% → 90%
- Code quality: Significant improvement
- Scope adherence: 50% → 85%
- Developer confidence: High increase

**Replication Guide**:
1. Train team on rhythm principles
2. Use timers for each phase
3. Document objectives clearly
4. Review rhythm effectiveness weekly

## Portfolio-Level Successes
